# Google Earth Engine Plugin for QGIS

The **QGIS Earth Engine Plugin** integrates [Google Earth Engine](http://earthengine.google.com) with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) using the [EE Python API](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api/tree/main/python).

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1️⃣ Install the Plugin

- Open **QGIS Plugin Manager** (`Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins`).
- Search for **"Google Earth Engine"** and install it.

### 2️⃣ Authenticate with your Google Earth Engine account

The plugin uses Google Earth Engine API and requires you to sign-in to your Google account. Complete the web-based authentication prompted by the plugin.

### 3️⃣ Select your Google Cloud Project ID

Google Earth Engine requires a **Google Cloud Project**. To find your Project ID:

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Your **Project ID** is visible in the URL or can be selected from the resource list.
- For more details, refer to the official [Google Cloud Project Management Guide](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).


See our [Step-by-Step Installtion Guide](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/installation) for detailed installation instructions.

## 🌍 Using Earth Engine in QGIS

With the code and algorithm tools below, the underlying Earth Engine assets are added as a [WMS](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/wms/) via our own custom QGIS Data Provider. To modify data pulled from Earth Engine, you must export it via the `Export` tools. The exception is if the `retain as vector layer` option is selected for the `Add Feature Collection` algorithm.


To export data, you may use the `Export Image as GeoTIFF` algorithm. For feature collections added with the `retain as vector layer`, you may also right-click on the layer and use QGIS' built-in export functionality.

### Code Usage

You can use Earth Engine datasets programmatically within QGIS using the `Python Console`:

```python
import ee
from ee_plugin import Map

image = ee.Image('USGS/SRTMGL1_003')
vis_params = {
    'min': 0, 'max': 4000,
    'palette': ['006633', 'E5FFCC', '662A00', 'D8D8D8', 'F5F5F5']
}
Map.addLayer(image, vis_params, 'Digital Elevation Model')
Map.setCenter(-121.753, 46.855, 9)
```

### Algorithms via Processing Toolbox and Plugin Menu

Earth Engine algorithms are available from:

- The **Processing Toolbox** (`Processing > Toolbox > Google Earth Engine`)
- The **Plugin Menu** (`Plugins > Google Earth Engine`)

See [available algorithms](#available-algorithms) for more details.

### Model Designer

Earth Engine algorithms can be integrated into QGIS **Model Designer** workflows:

- Open `Processing Toolbox > Models > Create New Model`
- Add and chain EE algorithms with other QGIS algorithms
- Save your custom processing model for repeated use

An [example model](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/blob/main/examples/srtm_hillshade.model3) is provided for the hillshade example below:

### Saving Your Project

Any layers and model workflows can be saved in your QGIS project file.  

Be sure to re-authenticate if opening the project on a new machine or after token expiry.

## ⚙️ Available Algorithms {#available-algorithms}

The following algorithms are currently implemented in the plugin:

| Algorithm Name              | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Add EE Image               | Loads a single Earth Engine image for viewing             |
| Add Image Collection       | Loads a filtered Earth Engine image collection for viewing|
| Export GeoTIFF             | Exports an EE image as a Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF to disk      |
| Add Feature Collection     | Loads a feature collection from Earth Engine  |

📌 Each algorithm includes in-dialog documentation to help guide usage directly within QGIS.

## 🗺️ Map Functions

The plugin supports several **Map API functions** similar to the Earth Engine Code Editor:

| Function                                                  | Description                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Map.addLayer(eeObject, visParams, name, shown, opacity)` | Adds a dataset to QGIS.             |
| `Map.centerObject(object, zoom)`                          | Centers the map on an object.       |
| `Map.getBounds(asGeoJSON)`                                | Returns map bounds.                 |
| `Map.getCenter()`                                         | Gets the current center of the map. |
| `Map.setCenter(lon, lat, zoom)`                           | Moves the center of the map.        |
| `Map.getScale()`                                          | Returns the current map scale.      |
| `Map.getZoom()`                                           | Returns the current zoom level.     |
| `Map.setZoom(zoom)`                                       | Sets a new zoom level.              |
