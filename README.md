### Troubleshooting

#### How to reset your authentication settings (and also fix some authentication errors)? 

Delete the credentials file and re-authenticate. The credentials file is located at:

```
Windows: C:\Users\USER\.config\earthengine\credentials 
Linux: /home/USER/.config/earthengine/credentials 
MacOS: /Users/USER/.config/earthengine/credentials
```

#### I am still getting authentication errors, what should I do?

Try installing the Google Earth Engine [command line client](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/command_line). Run the `earthengine authenticate` command. This resets the authentication credentials and solves most authentication errors.

More about GEE authentication guide and troubleshooting [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth).

#### Are you through a proxy?

In your scripts, configure proxy settings on top of them:

```python
import os
os.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = 'http://[username:password@]<ip_address_or_domain>:<port>'
os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://[username:password@]<ip_address_or_domain>:<port>'

import ee
from ee_plugin import Map
```

#### I am getting error like ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed on MacOS:

Open Finder and double clicking on this file `/Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command`. This path may vary depending on how QGIS was installed (Homebrew, macports, native). Then restart QGIS. 

#### Plugin crashes after authentication with a stack trace showing 404, what should I do?

Go to http://code.earthengine.google.com and make sure you can access code editor. If the plugin is still failing - make sure your IP is not under firewall.

#### Alpha 0.0.3 (Q4 2020) :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] EE raster layer inspector
- [x] Show some useful EE properties (bands, value types) in QGIS layer properties dialog
- [x] Fix GEE url authentication function if the credentials is not exists [#63](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/issues/63)
- [x] Fix crash if the authentication dialog is cancelled or not filled by the user
- [x] Init the Google Earth Engine user authorization system only when the user is going to use the plugin
- [x] Fixed the authentication dialog when the url shortener doesn't work by any reason [#66](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/issues/66)
- [x] Fix loading extra python dependencies to the plugin, fix [#62](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/issues/62)

#### Alpha 0.0.4 (Q1 2021) :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] Minor bugfix release (EE authentication)

#### Alpha 0.0.5 (Q1 2022) :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] Minor bugfix release (EE library upgrade)

#### Alpha 0.0.6 (Q1 2023) :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] Added support for QGIS 3.22+ (fix identify tool)

#### 1.0.0 (Q4 2023) :hourglass:
- [ ] Improve authentication (UI and error handling)
- [ ] Simplify interpoerability of features/geometry between EE and QGIS
- [ ] Add layer as a child layer to the group layer [#101](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/issues/101)
- [ ] EE vector layer inspector
- [ ] EE raster collection layer inspector
- [ ] Make print(ee_object) more user-friendly, without requiring getInfo(), maybe async
- [ ] Get Link and Open Script
- [ ] Skip import ee and from ee_plugin import Map for EE scripts
...

#### 1.1.0
- [ ] Export.* and Tasks panel (start, cancel, info)
- [ ] Map.layers() for EE layers, allowing to use things like ui.Map.Layer.setEeObject()
- [ ] ui.Chart.*
- [ ] require()
- [ ] Faster identify tool, using local cached rasters
- [ ] Add support for Data Catalog, allowing adding assets without the need to write scripts (select time, styling)
- [ ] Custom EE scripts as Processing algorithms, so that users can use it within Graphical Modeller
- [ ] Fetch (cache?) raster assets locally (EE > QGIS), for a given rectangle / CRS, as a Processing tool
- [ ] Export vector and raster data (QGIS > EE) either via Tasks or some other way
- [ ] Use QGIS vector/raster style editors to edit EE layer styles
